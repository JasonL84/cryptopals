# Cryptopals
A collection of my thoughts and musings as I go through the cryptopal challenges

To respect the wishes of those that mantain the challenges, I will not be posting solutions and any code that I do post will be utilities and handy snippits to automate some grunt work and will have nothing or very little to do with the solutions.

This repository will be updated weekly and will contain my thoughts and reflections about each challenge.
